## 📌 Tasks Completed

### ✅ TASK 1: Iris Flower Classification
- Used Scikit-learn’s built-in Iris dataset.
- Trained Logistic Regression model to classify flowers as *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*.
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualization included.

### ✅ TASK 2: Unemployment Analysis (India)
- Analyzed real-world unemployment data from India.
- Identified COVID-19's impact on unemployment.
- Heatmaps, line charts, and seasonal insights included.
- Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

### ✅ TASK 3: Car Price Prediction
- Built regression model to predict car resale price.
- Handled categorical encoding for car features like brand, fuel, transmission.
- Model evaluated using R² score, MAE, and RMSE.
- Visualized actual vs predicted prices.

### ✅ TASK 4: Sales Prediction using Advertising Data
- Predicted future sales based on spend in TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
- Used Linear Regression and plotted performance.
- Demonstrated correlation between media budget and sales.
- Tools: Scikit-learn, Seaborn.
